\title{Create an SPSS setup file (.sps) to use for reading in fixed-width text files}
\usage{
make_sps_setup(
  file_name,
  col_positions,
  col_names = NULL,
  col_labels = NULL,
  value_labels = NULL,
  missing_values = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{Name of the file to be saved (e.g. "setup_file1"). There is no need to put
the .sps extension in the file name.}

\item{col_positions}{Either a vector of strings indicating the start and end position of each column
(e.g. "1-3", "4-5") or a vector of the widths of the columns (e.g. 3, 2).}

\item{col_names}{A vector of names for the columns. If none are provided, will automatically
create names based on column number (e.g. V1, V2, V3).}

\item{col_labels}{A vector of labels for the columns. These are often longer and more descriptive
than the col_names. These are the values used as column names if
real_names = TRUE in reading in the data.}

\item{value_labels}{A vector with the value first, then an ' = ' then the label. Each
new column should have the column named followed by ' ='.}

\item{missing_values}{A vector of strings with the column name followed by the values to be
replaced by NA.}
}
\value{
Does not return any object. Saves the .sps file that is created.
}
\description{
make_sps_setup() is used to create the setup file used in reading in
fixed-width text files. Often the setup file comes with the data file but
in some cases (usually with government data) you will need to create
the setup file yourself.
