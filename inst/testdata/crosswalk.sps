 | DATA LIST:  Specifies the input data file to be read and assigns the   |
 | name, type, decimal specification (if any), and identifies variable    |
 | beginning and ending column locations. Users must replace              |
 | "file-specification" with a complete statement of the location of the  |
 | data file.                                                             |
 |                                                                        |
 | VARIABLE LABELS:  Assigns descriptive labels to variables. Variable    |
 | labels and variable names may be identical for certain variables.      |
 |                                                                        |
 | VALUE LABELS:  Assigns descriptive labels to codes in the data file.   |
 | Value labels may not be present for all variables in the data file.    |
 |                                                                        |
 | MISSING VALUES:  Declares user-defined missing values. These values    |
 | can be treated specially in data transformations, statistical          |
 | calculations, and case selection. Missing values may not be present    |
 | for all variables in the data file.                                    |
 |                                                                        |
 | MISSING VALUE RECODE:  Sets user-defined numeric missing values to     |
 | missing as interpreted by the SPSS system. Missing value recodes may   |
 | not be present for all variables in the data file.                     |
 |                                                                        |
 | NOTE:  Users should modify this SPSS setup to suit their specific      |
 | needs. MISSING VALUES and MISSING VALUE RECODE sections have been      |
 | marked by SPSS comment statements. To include these sections in a      |
 | final SPSS setup, users should remove the SPSS comment statements from |
 | the desired section(s).                                                |
